 Linking a Discord bot as a secure shell environment

# Use
The goal of this is to create an unpolished Discord bot while can execute bash commands for specific users.
These users should either be hardcoded with user ID (preventing unauthorized users from using the commands)

This essentially simulates a shared console environment.
